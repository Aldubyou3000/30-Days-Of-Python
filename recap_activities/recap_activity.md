# Recap Activity: Days 2-4

## 📝 Quick Recap

You've learned:

- **Day 2**: Variables, data types, built-in functions like `print()`, `len()`, `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, `input()`
- **Day 3**: Operators (arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`; comparison: `>`, `<`, `==`; logical: `and`, `or`)
- **Day 4**: Strings, concatenation, slicing, string methods, formatting

## 🎯 Programming Task

Build a **Student Grade Calculator** with the following requirements:

**What your program should do:**

1. Ask the user for their name (input as string)
2. Ask for marks in 3 subjects (input as integers)
3. Calculate the total marks and average
4. Display the result in a formatted way

**Expected Output Example:**

```
Enter your name: Alice
Enter marks for Subject 1: 75
Enter marks for Subject 2: 85
Enter marks for Subject 3: 90

--- Grade Report ---
Student: Alice
Total Marks: 250
Average: 83.33
```

**Requirements to practice:**

- ✅ Use `input()` and `print()` functions
- ✅ Use variables to store data
- ✅ Use arithmetic operators (`+`, `/`) to calculate
- ✅ Use string concatenation or f-strings for formatting output
- ✅ Convert between data types (string to integer)
- ✅ Use string methods like `.capitalize()`

---

## 💡 Hints

- Use `int()` to convert input strings to numbers
- Use f-strings: `f"Hello {name}"`
- Use `.capitalize()` to capitalize the first letter of the name
- The formula for average: `average = total / 3`
- Use `:.2f` in f-strings to format to 2 decimal places
